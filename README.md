## üèÅ Getting Started Locally

To run the entire application on your local machine, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.9+
-   Node.js v18+ and npm
-   Docker Desktop

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivam007kumar/customer-churn.git
cd H2h
```

### 2. Run the Backend API (via Docker)

This is the recommended method as it mirrors the production environment.

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t churn-prediction-api .

# Run the container
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 churn-prediction-api
```
The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### 3. Run the Frontend Application

This will start the React UI and the local Node.js proxy server.

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd churn-frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```
The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üìñ API Endpoints

The deployed FastAPI provides the following endpoints.

### Health Check

-   **Endpoint:** `GET /`
-   **Description:** A simple health check endpoint to verify that the service is running.
-   **Live URL:** [https://biutmmjpd7.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com/](https://biutmmjpd7.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com/)
-   **Success Response (200 OK):**
    ```json
    {
      "message": "Welcome to the Churn Prediction API!"
    }
    ```

### Predict Churn

-   **Endpoint:** `POST /predict`
-   **Description:** Predicts the churn probability for a single customer.
-   **Live URL:** [https://biutmmjpd7.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com/predict](https://biutmmjpd7.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com/predict)
-   **Success Response (200 OK):**
    ```json
    {
      "prediction": 0,
      "probability": 0.0872
    }
    ```
    -   `prediction`: `1` if the customer is likely to churn, `0` otherwise.
    -   `probability`: The model's calculated probability of the customer churning.

## üí° Key Challenges & Solutions

This project involved overcoming several real-world deployment challenges:

-   **Cross-Platform Docker Builds:** The model was developed on an Apple Silicon (ARM) machine, but the AWS deployment target was Linux (x86). This was solved by using the `docker build --platform linux/amd64` command to create a compatible image, preventing a low-level architecture crash on App Runner.
-   **Monorepo CI/CD Configuration:** The initial AWS Amplify builds failed because the React app was in a sub-directory. This was resolved by creating a detailed `amplify.yml` file with explicit, full paths for all build commands and artifacts, making the build process robust.
-   **Dependency Synchronization:** The strict `npm ci` command failed in the cloud due to a mismatch between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`. The issue was solved by switching to the more flexible `npm install` in the build configuration, which correctly resolved the minor dependency conflicts.
